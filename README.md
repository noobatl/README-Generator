## Description

Do you ever get tired of having to construct a new README.md file for every project you write? Sometimes the simple task of explaining what, why and how you developed a project is a grueling task. The README-Generator was built specifically for this reason, to make it easier to construct a README file without having to put the extra effort all the time. 

This project was built to ask the user relevant questions they might forget when building a new repo. It solves the question "Did I forget to put something in my README file?" by asking simple questions used to build a lengthy, well constructed README. 

In making this generator, I learned some valuable tools in node.js, such as, appending files, modularization, npm, arrow functions, let scope, constant referencing, functional loops, template literals, rest, spread, callback and object destructuring. 

This project is unique because it was built from scratch and will be updated everytime I write a new project. It will continue to get better over time.
